Release Notes for mpForm 1.3.x

General Changes
---------------
By default switched to a div-based layout. All pages created with earlier versions
of course keep their layout as it is (by default it was a table based layout in the past)

The style file has been cleaned up and a few new definitions have been added 
for the help popup dialog in div-based layout. Remember to copy the default style
files manually (or merge the changes into your local modifications) in order to 
pick up the improved style settings.

New Features
------------
In multi page forms the access to following pages is denied to all following pages 
unless the previous page has been submitted successfully

Feature Improvements
--------------------
In multi page forms submissions are handed over between the individual pages so that
the last page can send confirmation mails about all the submissions of the current page
and now also all previous pages. The data is stored in the session indexed by the 
submission id and could in principle be used in the private functions as well. 

The {HELP} placeholder works not only in table based layouts, but in general now.

French and Italian language support did not cover the error messages in the pear
file uploader tool. These missing language files have been added now.

Security Enhancements
---------------------

IDKEYs were not used throughout the module. In fact they were only used when 
Javascript and therefore Ajax was disabled. Now the Ajax-Helpers also use IDKEYs.
Also the Noscript-fallbacks for moving fields up and down use IDKEYs now.

Documentation
-------------
The feature changes described here are also reflected in the documentation.
The standard forms have also been updated and are based on div-layout now.

Bug fixes
---------
In the 1.2.x releases the icons for import/export for these buttons have been missing.
Now they are included in the module package.

The ajax drag&drop helper did use a wrong url for a icon in one of the message boxes. 
It has been corrected now.

A few other minor fixes in Ajax-Helpers, and their Noscript-fallbacks.
