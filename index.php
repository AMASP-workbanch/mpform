   WebsiteBaker CMS module: mpForm
   ===============================
   This module allows you to create customised online forms, such as a feedback form with file upload and email attachment mpForm allows forms over one or more pages.  User input for the same session_id will become a single row in the submitted table.  Since Version 1.1.0 many ajax helpers enable you to speed up the process of creating forms with this module.
